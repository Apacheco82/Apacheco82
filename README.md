<h3>Hello! I am a passionate programming student who is currently completing a Full Stack Developer bootcamp. During my time in the bootcamp, I have acquired skills in languages such as JavaScript, React, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and databases, among others. My goal is to continue learning and growing in the field of programming and develop creative and efficient solutions.</h3>


<h5>Before my career as a developer, I worked as an alarm central operator, where I acquired transferable skills such as the ability to work under pressure, make quick decisions, and solve problems in critical situations. I am excited to apply these skills in the world of technology.</h5>


Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to know more about my skills and experience!
